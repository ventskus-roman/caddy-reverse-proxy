# Static Website Deployment with Caddy Server

This template deploys a static website using the [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) server and works seamlessly with both [Railway](https://railway.app/?referralCode=alphasec) and [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/5552e11c260f). By default, the `site/` directory gets deployed as a static site. This can be modified by changing the Dockerfile.
